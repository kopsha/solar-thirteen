# ☀️ Solar Thirteen ☀️ sol-13

###### _An Astronomically Harmonized Timekeeping Proposal_

> A slight variation of the [13-month solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar):
> Current proposal is based on centering the year around the **summer solstice**, anchoring **Sol 1**
> (_the first day of the seventh month_) as the day **immediately following** the solstice.
> This places the solar peak of the natural year at the calendar's midpoint, symbolizing full maturity and abundance.
>
> From there, the calendar unfolds symmetrically: six months ascend toward the solstice (growing light),
> and six descend from it (waning light), mirroring natural rhythms. The start of the year (**Jan 1**)
> is positioned 168 days earlier, aligning with **deep winter dormancy**, marking a symbolic rebirth that culminates
> in the solstice's solar climax.


## Overview

This calendar reform proposes a fixed, solar-aligned calendar composed of **13 months of 28 days**, with **two special days** outside the weekly cycle:

* **Aurora**: A symbolic year-end "Rebirth Day," following the last month
* **Heliad**: A leap day inserted every four years in summer to maintain solar alignment

This structure offers perfect regularity (every month has exactly 4 weeks), reliable correspondence with astronomical events, and a symbolic elegance rooted in nature's rhythms.

### Months & Days

| Month # | Name         | Notes                                             |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Ianuarius    | Deep dormancy (post-winter solstice)              |
| 2       | Februarius   | Midwinter                                         |
| 3       | Martius      | Spring equinox \~ Martius 7                       |
| 4       | Aprilis      | Full spring                                       |
| 5       | Maius        | Floral bloom                                      |
| 6       | Junius       | Pre-solstice growth                               |
| ---     | **Heliad**   | Leap day (inserted every 4 years after Junius 28) |
| 7       | **Sol**      | Begins with solar maturity, follows solstice      |
| 8       | Julius       | Traditional July                                  |
| 9       | Augustus     | Traditional August                                |
| 10      | September    | Autumn equinox \~ September 7                     |
| 11      | October      | Late harvest                                      |
| 12      | November     | Cooling, dormancy returns                         |
| 13      | December     | Winter solstice \~ December 7                     |
| ---     | **Aurora**   | Year-end day, symbolic "Rebirth"                  |


### Week Structure

* Each month has exactly **28 days** = **4 weeks**
* Year has **364 regular days** + **1 or 2 extra days**:

  * **365** in common years (Aurora only)
  * **366** in leap years (Aurora + Heliad)

---


## Astronomical Alignment

### Fixed Anchor: Summer Solstice

* **Summer Solstice** fixed to **Junius 28** every year
* Ensures plants, seasonal markers, and cultural festivals remain in sync
* **Sol 1** always follows the solstice, marking full solar maturity

### Equinox & Solstice Placements (Approximate)

| Event           | Calendar Day | Gregorian Equivalent |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Spring Equinox  | Martius 7    | \~ March 20–21       |
| Summer Solstice | Junius 28    | \~ June 20–21        |
| Autumn Equinox  | September 7  | \~ September 22–23   |
| Winter Solstice | December 7   | \~ December 21–22    |

## Special Days

* **Aurora** (Day 365): Year-end reset, symbolizes renewal and rebirth
* **Heliad** (Leap Day): Solar correction day every 4 years, honors the sun

Both days are **outside the weekly cycle** — they are not assigned to a weekday, maintaining the 7-day week integrity year over year.

---

## Leap Year Rule

* Same complicated shift correction rules **Approx. one leap day (Heliad) every 4 years**
* Based on Julian principle (\~365.25 average year length)
* Keeps the solstice aligned with Junius 28 over centuries

---

## Philosophical Notes

* **Symmetry**: Perfect 4-week months, 13 months, and consistent seasonal anchors
* **Simplicity**: Easier planning, no irregular month lengths
* **Symbolism**: Aurora (Rebirth), Heliad (Sun), Sol (solar apex) add mythic and poetic depth
* **Ecological Awareness**: Tracks plant cycles and sun-driven life rhythms more closely than the Gregorian calendar
