## _An Astronomically Harmonized Timekeeping Proposal_

This calendar begins not in the blaze of summer or the bloom of spring, but in the **stillness
of the winter solstice** — when the Earth dreams deepest, when light begins again from its
faintest whisper. From that moment of cosmic hush, the year unfurls like a spiral of breath:  
six months of ascending brightness, and six of gentle return.

At its heart lies the *month of Sol*, the golden summit, where the *summer solstice* graces the
*14th or 15th day*. There, the Sun stands proud and complete, midway between shadow and shadow —
a symbol of maturity, fullness, and the quiet triumph of balance.

Thus the year is not a march, but a breathing pattern: dormancy to dawn, radiance to rest — the
same rhythm that moves the tides, the crops, the pulse of every living thing.


## Overview

This proposal envisions a **solar-synchronous calendar** of **13 equal months*, each a perfect
cycle of **28 days** — _four pristine weeks_ that repeat like stanzas in a song.
And yet, two days live beyond the reach of any week — the holy pauses in time’s metronome:
- **Aurora** — the _Rebirth Day_, following the last month; a threshold day when one year dies
  into light and another is born.
- **Heliad** — the _Leap of Fire_, a day set every four years after _Junius 28_, restoring harmony
  with the Sun’s slow drift — a spark cast into time to keep its orbit true.

This structure gives not only mathematical grace — every month alike, every week unbroken — but also
a symbolic wholeness. The heavens dictate, and the calendar answers, _not with obedience, but with
reverence_.

## Calendar Structure

### Months & Days

| Month # | Name         | Notes                                             |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ---     | **Aurora**   | Last year-end day (Winter solstice)               |
| 1       | Ianuarius    | Deep dormancy, _the earth held in sacred sleep_   |
| 2       | Februarius   | Purification and endurance, _the heart of winter's discipline_ |
| 3       | Martius      | The stirring beneath frost, _life quickens in the soil_        |
| 4       | Aprilis      | Blossoming light, _spring growing toward balance_ |
|         |              | Spring Equinox falls around 5-6                   |
| 5       | Maius        | Floral abundance, _greening and renewal_          |
| 6       | Junius       | Green fullness before the blaze, _the climb toward solar height_ |
| ---     | **Heliad**   | The leap of the Sun — a radiant insertion every   |
|         |              | fourth year, after Junius 28                      |
| 7       | **Sol**      | The zenith month, _the Sun crowned high_              |
|         |              | Summer Solstice falls around 14-15                |
| 8       | Julius       | Long afternoons and the warmth that lingers, _the sweet overreach of summer_  |
| 9       | Augustus     | Amber descent, _first breath of harvest wind_     |
| 10      | September    | Balance and gleaning, _the harvest_               |
|         |              | Autumn Equinox September 23-25                    |
| 11      | October      | Waning plenty, _the fields quiet_                 |
| 12      | November     | Cooling and retreat, _the hush before the veil of frost_ |
| 13      | December     | The darkening, _days shorten toward renewal_      |
| ---     | **Aurora**   | The still day beyond time, Rebirth and Solstice,  |
|         |              | where the Sun turns once again toward dawn.       |
|         |              | _the single day that stands apart_                |


### Week Structure

Each month flows with the same steady rhythm: _four weeks_ of _seven days_, an even pulse
of _28 days_.

The year holds _364 regular days_, with its sacred additions:
- **Aurora** alone in common years, a single breath between cycles. _(365 days total)_
- **Aurora** and **Heliad** in leap years, a perfect harmony of pattern and pulse. _(366 days total)_

---

Here time regains its poetry.  
The months no longer tumble in arbitrary sequence but rise and fall with the sky itself.  
The Sun's journey becomes the world's calendar — a dialogue between orbit and awareness,
between eternity and the turning of a single, perfect year.

## Astronomical Alignment

### Fixed Anchor: Winter Solstice

_Simulation_: Solar calendars new year day is aligned on Dec 21, 2025 (with the winter soltice)

| Event             |        Calendar Day        |  Gregorian Equivalent   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Winter Solstice   | Aurora, 2025               | \~ December 21, 2025    |
| Solar year starts | Monday, January 1st, 2026  | \~ December 22, 2025    |
| Old new year      | Thurs., January 11, 2026   | \~ January 1st, 2026    |
| Spring Equinox    | Friday, April 5, 2026      | \~ March 20, 2026       |
| Summer Solstice   | Sunday, Sol 14, 2026       | \~ June 21, 2026        |
| Autumn Equinox    | Wedns., September 25, 2026 | \~ September 23, 2026   |
| Solar year ends   | Sunday, December 28, 2026  | \~ December 20, 2026    |
| Winter Solstice   | Aurora, 2026               | \~ December 21, 2026    |

## Leap Year Rule

* Same complicated shift correction rules **Approx. one leap day (Heliad) every 4 years**
* Based on Julian principle (\~365.25 average year length)
* Keeps the solstice aligned over centuries

---

## Philosophical Notes

* **Symmetry**: Perfect 4-week months, 13 months, and consistent seasonal anchors
* **Simplicity**: Easier planning, no irregular month lengths
* **Symbolism**: Aurora (Rebirth), Heliad (Sun), Sol (solar apex) add mythic and poetic depth
* **Ecological Awareness**: Tracks plant cycles and sun-driven life rhythms more closely than the Gregorian calendar
